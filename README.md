### Phishing Regexp
Test for phishing emails and "password" labels regexp list used for checking survey forms and "free sites" such as weebly.com, weeblysite.com, square.site, webflow.io, wixsite.com, godaddysites.com, sitebeat.crazydomains.com, myfreesites.net, ukit.me, urest.org, where auto-generated contact forms can be used for phishing. Trying to analyze each one with machine learning / AI tools is counterproductive if a certain match from the form label is enough.
